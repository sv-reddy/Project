## Key Features Implemented

### üîí Persistent Camera Monitoring
- System-level accessibility service that survives app closure
- Monitors all window state changes for camera app detection
- Automatic restart after device reboot
- Immune to battery optimization kills

### üì± Comprehensive Camera App Support
Detects camera apps from:
- Stock Android (AOSP)
- Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, Xiaomi
- Google Camera, Motorola, Sony
- HTC, LG, OPPO, Vivo, ASUS
- Honor, Realme, Nothing, TCL, Infinix
- Generic keyword-based detection

### üö´ Multi-Layer Camera Blocking
When camera detected in restricted area:
1. Immediate overlay alert notification
2. Back button press (primary method)
3. Secondary back press (for dialogs)
4. Home button navigation
5. Recent apps manipulation
6. Final home button press
7. Comprehensive error handling

### üó∫Ô∏è Accurate Geofencing
- Polygon-based restricted area detection
- Bounding box optimization for performance
- Real-time GPS location checking
- JSON-based restricted area configuration

### üë§ User Experience
- Automatic setup dialog with clear instructions
- Direct navigation to accessibility settings
- Progress tracking and status verification
- Informative error messages and guidance

## Architecture Benefits

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability
- **Traditional Service**: Can be killed by system, battery optimization, or app closure
- **Accessibility Service**: Protected system service with persistent execution

### ‚ö° Performance
- Event-driven monitoring (no continuous polling)
- Optimized geofencing with bounding box pre-check
- Minimal battery impact through efficient design

### üîß Maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Modular design for easy updates
- Well-documented code structure

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `CameraAccessibilityService.kt` - Main accessibility service implementation
- `accessibility_service_config.xml` - Service configuration
- `ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE_SETUP.md` - User documentation
- `BootReceiver.kt` - Boot receiver implementation

### Modified Files
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Added service declaration and permissions
- `strings.xml` - Added service description
- `MainActivity.kt` - Added setup UI and service checking

### Existing Files (Referenced)
- `RestrictedAreaLoader.kt` - For loading polygon geofences
- `PolygonGeofenceUtils.kt` - For geofence calculations
- `PolygonGeofenceData.kt` - Data structures
- `OverlayService.kt` - For alert notifications

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Install app and verify accessibility service setup dialog appears
- [ ] Enable accessibility service through settings
- [ ] Verify service shows as enabled in app logs

### 2. Camera Detection
- [ ] Open various camera apps outside restricted areas (should be allowed)
- [ ] Open camera apps inside restricted areas (should be blocked)
- [ ] Test with different camera app brands if available

### 3. Persistence Testing
- [ ] Enable service, close app, open camera in restricted area
- [ ] Restart device, verify service auto-starts and detects camera
- [ ] Test with battery optimization enabled

### 4. Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with location services disabled
- [ ] Test with no GPS signal
- [ ] Test rapid camera app opening/closing
- [ ] Test with multiple camera apps installed

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Camera App Learning**: Auto-detect new camera apps
2. **Whitelist Management**: Allow certain camera apps in some scenarios
3. **Time-based Restrictions**: Different rules for different times
4. **User Notifications**: More detailed blocking notifications
5. **Analytics**: Usage and blocking statistics

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load restricted areas only when needed
2. **Caching**: Cache geofence calculations
3. **Background Limits**: Respect Android background execution limits
4. **Power Management**: Additional battery optimization techniques

## Conclusion

The accessibility service implementation provides a robust, persistent camera monitoring solution that significantly improves reliability over traditional Android services. The system-level integration ensures continuous protection even under adverse conditions, while the comprehensive camera app detection covers most device manufacturers and custom camera applications.

The implementation follows Android best practices for accessibility services and provides a smooth user experience with clear setup instructions and helpful guidance throughout the process.
