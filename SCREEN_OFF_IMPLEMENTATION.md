# Screen-Off Functionality Implementation Summary

## Problem Addressed
The GeoCamOff app was not working properly when the screen was turned off (screen lock/sleep mode). This is different from device reboot and relates to Android's Doze mode, app standby, and background processing limitations that occur when the screen goes off.

## Root Cause
When Android screen turns off, the system:
1. **Enters Doze Mode**: Limits network access, alarms, jobs, and syncs
2. **App Standby**: Puts unused apps in standby mode
3. **Background Limits**: Restricts background processing for battery optimization
4. **Location Services**: May reduce frequency or stop location updates
5. **Wake Lock Management**: Apps need special handling to continue working

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Screen State Management (`ScreenStateReceiver.kt`)
- **Comprehensive broadcast receiver** for screen ON/OFF/USER_PRESENT events
- **Partial wake lock management** with 30-minute timeout for background operation
- **Service notification system** to inform services about screen state changes
- **Power management optimization** methods for different screen states

### 2. Enhanced Camera Detection Service (`CameraDetectionService.kt`)
- **Screen state receiver registration** within the service
- **Wake lock acquisition/release** for background operation when screen is off
- **Enhanced foreground service notifications** with higher priority for screen-off scenarios
- **Specialized handling** for screen-off and user-present optimizations
- **Proper cleanup** in onDestroy() method

### 3. Enhanced Accessibility Service (`CameraAccessibilityService.kt`)
- **Screen state monitoring** and optimization
- **Wake lock management** for continued accessibility monitoring
- **Background location updates** for better accuracy when screen is off
- **Power management** that adapts to screen state changes
- **Proper receiver cleanup** to prevent memory leaks

### 4. State Management Enhancement (`StateManager.kt`)
- **Screen state tracking** with `setScreenState()` and `isScreenOn()` methods
- **Centralized state management** accessible by all services
- **Proper state persistence** for cross-service communication

### 5. Manifest Configuration (`AndroidManifest.xml`)
- **ScreenStateReceiver registration** with proper intent filters
- **Required permissions** already present (WAKE_LOCK, etc.)
- **Service configurations** with appropriate foreground service types

## Key Features Implemented

### Power Management
- **Partial wake locks** to keep CPU running when screen is off
- **Intelligent wake lock management** (acquire when screen off, release when user present)
- **Battery-optimized timeouts** (10-15 minutes with automatic renewal)

### Screen State Handling
- **Real-time screen state detection** (ON/OFF/USER_PRESENT)
- **Service optimization** based on screen state
- **Enhanced notifications** for screen-off scenarios
- **Background location request management**

### Service Continuity
- **Foreground service with high priority** during screen-off
- **Camera monitoring continuity** regardless of screen state
- **Accessibility service optimization** for background operation
- **Proper cleanup and resource management**

## How It Works

### When Screen Turns OFF:
1. `ScreenStateReceiver` detects `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF`
2. Updates `StateManager.setScreenState(false)`
3. Notifies services via intents (`SCREEN_OFF_OPTIMIZATION`)
4. Services acquire wake locks and enhance notifications
5. Location services switch to background mode
6. Camera monitoring continues with power optimization

### When Screen Turns ON:
1. `ScreenStateReceiver` detects `ACTION_SCREEN_ON`
2. Updates `StateManager.setScreenState(true)`
3. Services optimize for foreground operation
4. Wake lock management is reduced (but maintained for some services)

### When User is Present:
1. `ScreenStateReceiver` detects `ACTION_USER_PRESENT`
2. Services release wake locks (user is actively using device)
3. Background location updates are stopped
4. Services return to normal foreground operation

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `ScreenStateReceiver.kt` - Complete screen state management

### Modified Files:
- `CameraDetectionService.kt` - Enhanced with power management
- `CameraAccessibilityService.kt` - Added screen state optimization
- `StateManager.kt` - Added screen state tracking
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Registered ScreenStateReceiver

## Testing

### Automated Test:
Run `test_screen_off_functionality.ps1` to verify basic functionality

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Install and start the app**
2. **Turn screen off** (power button)
3. **Wait 30 seconds** with screen off
4. **Try opening camera** (if possible with screen off)
5. **Turn screen back on**
6. **Check notifications** for camera detection alerts
7. **Verify continued functionality**

### Battery Optimization:
- **Disable battery optimization** for GeoCamOff in device settings
- **Allow background activity** in app settings
- **Add to battery whitelist** if available

## Expected Behavior

With this implementation, the GeoCamOff app should:
- ✅ **Continue monitoring camera usage** when screen is off
- ✅ **Detect camera apps opening** in background
- ✅ **Show notifications** for camera detection even with screen off
- ✅ **Close camera apps** when detected in restricted areas
- ✅ **Maintain location awareness** for geofencing
- ✅ **Optimize battery usage** through intelligent wake lock management
- ✅ **Handle all screen state transitions** properly

## Important Notes

### Battery Impact:
- **Partial wake locks** have minimal battery impact compared to full wake locks
- **Intelligent timeout management** prevents excessive battery drain
- **Automatic cleanup** when user is present reduces unnecessary power usage

### Android Limitations:
- Some OEM customizations may still limit background processing
- **Battery optimization settings** must be configured properly
- **Doze mode whitelist** may be needed on some devices

### Compatibility:
- Works on **Android 6.0+** (API 23+)
- **Enhanced for Android 8.0+** with foreground service improvements
- **Compatible with modern Android versions** including Android 12+

This implementation provides a robust solution for maintaining app functionality when the screen is off, addressing the core issue of Android's aggressive power management interfering with security monitoring applications.
